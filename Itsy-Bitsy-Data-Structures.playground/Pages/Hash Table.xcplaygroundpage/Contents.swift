  Lists are great for fast access and dealing with items at the end. However,
  as we've seen it isn't great at dealing with items not at the end of the
  list and we have to manually hold onto memory addresses.
 
  So let's take a look at a different data structure and how it deals with
  adding, accessing, and removing values without needing to know memory
  addresses.

/*:
  A hash table is a data structure that's *unordered*. Instead we have "keys" and "values" where we
  computed an address in memory using the key.
 
  The basic idea is that we have keys that are "hashable" (which we'll get to
  in a second) and can by used to add, access, and remove from memory very
  efficiently.
 
      var hashTable = HashTable()
 
      hashTable.set('myKey', 'myValue')
      hashTable.get('myKey') // >> 'myValue'

     */

/*:
  In order to store key-value pairs in memory from our hash table we need a
  way to take the key and turn it into an address. We do this through an
  operation known as "hashing".
 
  Basically it takes a key and serializes it into a unique number for that
  key.
 
     hashKey("abc") =>  96354
     hashKey("xyz") => 119193
 
  You have to be careful though, if you had a really big key you don't want
  to match it to a memory address that does not exist.
 
  So the hashing algorithm needs to limit the size, which means that there
  are a limited number of addresses for an unlimited number of values.
 
  The result is that you can end up with collisions. Places where two keys
  get turned into the same address.
 
  Any real world hash table implementation would have to deal with this,
  however we are just going to glaze over it and pretend that doesn't happen.
